    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crispy corn is a popular restaurant-style snack that is crunchy, spicy, and full of flavor. It is made by deep-frying boiled sweet corn kernels until golden and crisp, then tossing them in a mix of spices and herbs. This quick and easy snack is loved for     its crunchy texture on the outside and soft juiciness inside.<br>
    The corn is first coated lightly with flour (cornflour and rice flour or maida) which helps it turn extra crunchy after frying. Once fried, it is seasoned with red chili powder, chaat masala, black salt, pepper, and finely chopped onions, capsicum, and coriander leaves. A squeeze of lemon juice is added at the end to enhance the tangy taste.
Crispy corn is best served hot as a starter or evening snack, often paired with green chutney or enjoyed as it is.

<h3>Ingredient</h3>
<ul>

    <li>3 tbsp cornflour</li>
    <li>2 tbsp rice flour (or maida/all-purpose flour as substitute)</li>
    <li>½ tsp red chili powder</li>
    <li>½ tsp black pepper powder</li>
    <li>½ tsp chaat masala</li>
    <li>½ tsp salt (adjust to taste)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste (optional, for extra flavor)</li>
    <li>1 medium onion (finely chopped)</li>
    <li>½ capsicum (finely chopped, optional)</li>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Boil the Corn </strong>
        Take 2 cups of sweet corn kernels.
        Boil them for 3–4 minutes in salted water.
        Drain completely (moisture should be minimal, else coating won’t stick).</li>
    <li><strong>Coat the Corn</strong>In a bowl, mix:
3 tbsp cornflour
2 tbsp rice flour (or maida substitute)
½ tsp red chili powder
½ tsp black pepper powder
½ tsp salt
Add the boiled corn to this dry mixture.
Sprinkle 1–2 tsp water (just enough for flour to coat) → don’t make a batter, keep it dry & crumbly.</li>
    <li><strong>Deep Fry the Corn</strong>

Heat oil in a deep pan on medium-high flame.

Drop coated corn in small batches (avoid overcrowding).

Fry until golden brown & crispy (around 3–4 minutes).

Remove and place on tissue paper to absorb excess oil.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Tossing Mix</strong>
In a mixing bowl, add:
1 medium onion (finely chopped)
½ capsicum (finely chopped, optional)
2 tbsp coriander leaves (finely chopped)
½ tsp chaat masala
½ lemon juice
Extra chili powder/salt if needed</li>
    <li><strong>Final Toss</strong>
Add the hot crispy corn to the tossing mix.
Toss well so that onions, masala, and lemon coat evenly.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve Immediately</strong>
Enjoy hot & crispy with green chutney or ketchup.</li>
